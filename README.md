1. **What is the exchange rate for the Infini Card?**

Infini Card's exchange rate is based on real-time international bank exchange rates, which are quite close to the rates found on Google. If the amount you are paying is very small (under $0.5), it may trigger the minimum foreign exchange fee, so please try to avoid making very small transactions. Additionally, if you are using the Rabbit Card, there will be an extra $0.50 currency conversion fee when paying non-U.S. merchants. We recommend using the Lite Card or Global Card for daily expenses and the Rabbit Card for payments to services like X or ChatGPT.
